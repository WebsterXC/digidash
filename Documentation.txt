Hello. This file steps you through how to setup a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Jessie to use DigiDash.

First, the following is a list of required hardware:
-Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
-Official Raspberry Pi 7" Touchscreen Display
-MicroSD card (Preferably at least 8GB)
-ELM327 OBDII Bluetooth Adapter (Preferably running the ELM327 v2.1 protocol)
-Micro USB cable (for powering the Pi)
-USB Keyboard (for setup only)

The following is a list of useful, additional hardware:
-12V to USB Car Adapter (required if your car does not already have a USB port. Preferably at least 2 Amps.)
-iOttie Easy One Touch 2 Car Mount for iPhone & Smartphones
-Case for Raspberry Pi Official 7" Touchscreen Display (3D printer files included in DigiDash repository)
-8 M3x6 screws

Once all hardware is gathered and assembled, it's time to setup the Pi. If this is your first time using your Pi, you must first install the Raspbian Jessie OS on your MicroSD card. If you want the fastest possible boot time for your Pi, it is highly recommended that you do not use NOOBS to install Raspbian.
Once Raspbian is installed, it will presumably boot into its desktop GUI. If it does not, simply enter the following line into the command line interface to boot the GUI:
    startx
If your screen is upside-down, edit the file /boot/config.txt and add this line:
    lcd_rotate=2
If you see an undervoltage warning on the top-right of your screen and would like to make it disappear, add this line to the same file:
    avoid_warnings=1
For these changes take effect, you must reboot your system by entering the following command:
    sudo reboot

Next, you should make sure that your Pi's localization settings are correct (otherwise, you may have trouble typing in later commands). Open the Pi's home drop-down menu, then choose Preferences->Raspberry Pi Configuration. Choose the Localization tab, then ensure that all options match your preferences. Save your changes by hitting OK, and reboot your Pi if prompted.

Next, you must install the packages that DigiDash requires to run. Make sure that your Pi is connected to the internet. Then, open the terminal and enter the following lines:
    sudo apt-get install git
    sudo apt-get install python-bluez

To install Kivy:
    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev pkg-config libgl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev python-setuptools libgstreamer1.0-dev git-core gstreamer1.0-plugins-{bad,base,good,ugly} gstreamer1.0-{omx,alsa} python-dev cython
    sudo pip install --upgrade cython
    sudo pip install git+https://github.com/kivy/kivy.git@master
To configure Kivy to use the touchscreen as an input source, edit the file ~/.kivy/config.ini and go to the [input] section. Add this:
    mouse = mouse
    mtdev_%(name)s = probesysfs,provider=mtdev
    hid_%(name)s = probesysfs,provider=hidinput
Please note: If this file doesn't exist, then save this step for later. After running DigiDash (or any other program that uses Kivy), the file will be created.

All required packages have now been installed! To ensure that everything on your Pi is up-to-date, enter the following commands in your terminal:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
    sudo apt-get autoremove
    sudo rpi-update
Then reboot:
    sudo reboot

To download DigiDash itself, open the terminal and enter the following commands:
    cd
    mkdir repositories
    cd repositories
    git clone https://github.com/WebsterXC/digidash.git	
It's now time to add a custom shell command to run DigiDash:
    cd /usr/local/bin
    sudo nano digidash
In this new file, add the following two lines and then save:
    #!/bin/bash
    sh -c 'cd ~/repositories/digidash/src/ && exec python main.py'
Now, make this file executable:
    sudo chmod +x digidash

To set DigiDash to auto-run on startup:
    sudo nano /etc/profile
Scroll to the bottom and add the following line:
    digidash

Lastly, you must set your Pi to boot to the command line. Not only does this speed up boot time, but it also solves an issue that results when DigiDash runs halfway through the desktop GUI booting. This occurs if your Pi autoruns Digidash while booting to the desktop GUI. Open the Pi's home drop-down menu, then choose Preferences->Raspberry Pi Configuration. Select "Boot: TO CLI" and then hit OK.

You're now good to go! Reboot you Pi and experience some good ol' DigiDash fun!
