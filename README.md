## A plug-and-play digital dashboard and engine monitor. ##
======================================================================

### About ###
This is a University at Buffalo, CSE442 group project. Our goal is to create a plug-and-play 
digital dashboard by grabbing data from a vehicle's CAN bus. Our project will use a Raspberry Pi
as the center of processing for both CAN bus data and a touchscreen / GUI display. The purpose
is to provide more vehicle information than the tradition analog dashboard while also implementing
higher-level engine monitoring functions that run in the backgroup.

This project is provided as open-source under the GNU GPL V3 license. Enjoy!
