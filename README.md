## A complete plug-and-play digital dashboard and engine monitor. ##
======================================================================

### About ###
This is a University at Buffalo, CSE442 group project. Our goal is to create a plug-and-play 
digital dashboard by grabbing data from a vehicle's CAN bus. Our project is bottom-up 
embedded development; our group members will be developing both hardware and software 
simultaneously and use Scrum methodology to keep the project headed in the right direction.
