## A plug-and-play digital dashboard and engine monitor. ##

### About
DigiDash is an auxilliary dashboard made from a Raspberry Pi and 7" RGB touchscreen, compatible with 
all OBDI-II compliant vehicles. Using a standard ELM327 OBD-II Bluetooth dongle found on sites like 
Amazon.com, users can use a Raspberry Pi to quickly and easily read and record data from their vehicle. DigiDash provides an easy to use GUI that
provides as many or as few additional gauges the driver wants to look at. The unit was designed 
with user-customizability in mind - all colors, styles, fonts, and backgrounds are configurable
for the driver and nearly every object can be repositioned with the integrated touch screen.

This project started as a semester project for CSE442 at SUNY Buffalo. The project is provided as
open-source under the GNU GPL V3 license. Enjoy!
